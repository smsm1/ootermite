## Subversion repository layout ##

The current developer version resides in `/trunk/`. There are subdirectories for the different modules; the most important one ist `/trunk/buildbot/`.

In `/branches/` reside as one can expect the branches. For every major release we branch the trunk.

The name of the branch dir should reflect the version of the release, e.g.:

`/branches/0.1.1_buildbot0.7.5/` for the ootermite version 0.1.1 that needs Buildbot version 0.7.5.
