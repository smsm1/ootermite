= Slave Basedir Layout =

The following files/scripts should reside within the ootermite slave basedir:

  * bootstrap
  * buildprep
  * bundle
  * compile
  * configure
  * cws_get
  * cws_get.config
  * sloccount
  * smoketestoo

These files can be obtained through Subversion (trunk/buildbot/buildslave/scripts/).

The file _buildbot.tac_ is created through the buildbot create-slave command. If this file is missing the Buildbot will not recognize the slave's basedir! It is important because it contains basic (but important) information about the slave-master connection.

  * info/admin: Contains mail address of the slave's admin
  * info/host: Contains information about the host machine the slave is running on. Should be customized.
