This page is for the status of the buildbot system.

== Buildbots ==

The CVS column tells you whether the bot is building whenever there is a CVS commit.

== EIS/Tinderbox ==

Due to the issue 35, we are currently experiencing all builds started from a CVS commit or IRC to not have the final status submitted.
The status is getting updated in any other case.
Issue 35 appears to have been fixed, but we now have a problem where the tinderbox isn't properly dealing with the mails.

== Build Master ==

Running as expected, occasional restarts while debugging to fix bugs, thus the loss of some builds.

== Installset Serving ==
Working as expected. All install sets are served from http://termite.go-oo.org/install_sets/. They currently need to be specifically requested through the web pages. Not all bots are uploading them.
