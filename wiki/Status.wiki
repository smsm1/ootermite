This page is for the status of the buildbot system.

= Buildbots =

The CVS column tells you whether the bot is building whenever there is a CVS commit.

|| pumbaa-etch || O3 Build || Christian Lohmaier || No || Reliably building. Builds are initiated by buildbot owner based on the tinderbox status ||

= EIS/Tinderbox Status =

Due to the issue 35, we are currently experiencing all builds started from a CVS commit or IRC to not have the final status submitted.
The status is getting updated in any other case.
