This page is for the status of the buildbot system.

== Buildbots ==

The CVS column tells you whether the bot is building whenever there is a CVS commit.

== EIS/Tinderbox ==

Mails appear to be going across to the tinderbox fine. Large logs occasionally cause a problem.

== Build Master ==

Running as expected, occasional restarts while debugging to fix bugs, thus the loss of some currently running builds.

Most development is currently on the [http://140.211.166.227:8010/ development server]

== Installset Serving ==
Working as expected. All install sets are served from http://termite.go-oo.org/install_sets/. They currently need to be specifically requested through the web pages. Not all bots are uploading them.
