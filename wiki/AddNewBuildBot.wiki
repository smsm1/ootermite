There is a number of things that you need to do to add a new build slave.

You will need the following prerequisites:

  * python 2.4 or later
  * twisted 2.4 or later
  * perl (and the following modules: LWP::Simple, File::Copy::Recursive, Config::Auto
  * bash
  * subversion (for the buildbot scripts)
  * cvs (for OpenOffice.org source)

  # Grab a copy of buildbot 0.7.5 [https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=73177 source]
  # unpack the source
  # build the buildbot [http://buildbot.net/repos/release/docs/buildbot.html#Installing-the-code the buildbot manual]
  # create the build-slave

  # Edit the info/admin and info/host files to contain information about yourself/host
  # Customise the scripts for your platform
