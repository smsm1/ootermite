#summary How to add a new bot
#labels slave
= Introduction =

There is a number of things that you need to do to add a new build slave. Slightly fuller/alternative instructions are available from [AddNewBuildBotMacOSX].

You will need the following prerequisites:

  * a working build environment for OpenOffice.org. Please make sure that you have already managed to built OpenOffice.org on the machine that you want to put the bot on.
  * python 2.4 or later (Use *python -V* to get the python version number)
  * twisted 2.4 or later
  * perl (and the following modules: LWP::Simple, File::Copy::Recursive, Config::Auto which can be installed from CPAN)
{{{
sudo perl -MCPAN -e shell
install LWP::Simple
install File::Copy::Recursive
install Config::Auto
exit
}}}
  * bash
  * subversion (for the buildbot scripts)
  * cvs (for OpenOffice.org source)

= Details =

  # Grab a copy of buildbot 0.7.8 [https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=73177 source]
  # Unpack the source
  # Build the buildbot [http://buildbot.net/repos/release/docs/buildbot.html#Installing-the-code the buildbot manual]
  # Create the build-slave
{{{
buildbot create-slave BASEDIR termite.go-oo.org:9999 SLAVENAME PASSWORD
}}}
  This will create a Build Slave Basedir and the important buildbot.tac file.
  # Grab the scripts from svn directly in to the BASEDIR
{{{
svn checkout http://ootermite.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/buildbot/buildslave/scripts/ BASEDIR
}}}
  # Edit the info/admin and info/host files to contain information about yourself/host
  # Customise the scripts for your platform
  # Create a build_copy dir (used by buildprep) with things you wish to be copied into the source tree after checkout and before configure (such as moz)
  # Email mikeleib or shaunmcdonald the name and password to add your bot to the master
  # Start your bot
{{{
buildbot start BASEDIR
}}}
  # It should show up as online at http://termite.go-oo.org/ and you should be able to manually submit builds to it.
