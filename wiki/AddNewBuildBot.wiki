= Introduction =

There is a number of things that you need to do to add a new build slave.

You will need the following prerequisites:

* a working build environment for OpenOffice.org. Please make sure that you have already managed to build OpenOffice.org on the machine that you want to put the bot on.
* python 2.4 or later
* twisted 2.4 or later
* perl
* bash
* svn (for the buildbot scripts)
* cvs (for OpenOffice.org source)
