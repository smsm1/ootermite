This branch contains the scripts specially designed for Sun's
inhouse buildbots that build agains a baseline.
For people outside Sun this is of little interest, but we have
to respect the GPL and have to publish our changes to Buildbot.

master				buildmaster related config files/code.
slave/				scripts needed for a build slave, 
				these may need to be customised to the 
				specific buildslave environment.
master/OO-changes.diff		hacks to buildbot to introduce OOo 
				specific features.
