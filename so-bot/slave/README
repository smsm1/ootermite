= SCRIPTS TO SETUP A BUILDBOT =

== Builder bots ==

These files invoked by the buildslave to perform various steps
outlined below.  Note that you may need to modify these for your platform or build slave.
The process for building OpenOffice.org/StarOffice is in the following order:

setsolar		Setups a build environment and patchs to correct values. 
			Currently a slave works per default on the so-cwsserv02.

fetch 			Optional step that can fetch a CWS from the version control system.	

build			Performs a build --all from instsetoo_native and instset_native.	

== Notes for the above scripts ==
These should work out the box on as many platforms as possible.

A return code of 65 means that the command should be skipped.
