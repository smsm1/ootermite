These files invoked by the buildslave to perform various steps
outlined below.  Note that you may need to modify these for your platform or build slave.
The process for building OpenOffice.org is in the following order:

cwsget.pl 		For getting CWS's from CVS

newget			replacement for cwsget.pl under development

(You only need to use one of the above scripts, this will depend on the configuration on the buildmaster.)

buildprep		Insert whatever you need in here to prepare the tree for
			building.  For example, copying mozilla or patching

configure		Runs configure, you supply configure line

bootstrap		Runs bootstrap

compile			Actually does the compile

bundle			Zips up the install set.  The name is supplied
			in $1 by the buildmaster.
