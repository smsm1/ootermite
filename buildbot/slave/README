=SCRIPTS TO SETUP A BUILDBOT=

==Builder bots==

These files invoked by the buildslave to perform various steps
outlined below. The idea is not to modify these scripts in any way. There are two config files which you may need to modify  for your platform or build slave.
Additionally there are some hooks that call certain scripts at certain times i
which you can put in place with your own content if needed. More below.

The process for building OpenOffice.org is in the following order:

cws_fetch 		For getting CWS's from CVS
cws_fetch.cfg		Config file for cws_fetch

buildprep		Apply patches and copy files into the sourcetree
			there are 3 directories which are copied into the 
			sourcetree. The directory "build_copy" can contain these 
			directories named as follows:
				Common
				<Master>_<Minor> (eg: DEV300_m66)
				<Master>/<Minor> (eg: DEV300/m66)
			After copying all patches named *.patch or *.diff in 
			the source_root directory are applied.
			For example, copying mozilla, that daft windows.dll s

configure		Runs configure, you supply configure switches in steps.config

bootstrap		Runs bootstrap

compile			Actually does the compile

smoketestoo		Run the smoketest after the build

bundle			Zips up the install set.

subsequenttests		performs lots of tests.

bot_backup              creates the tar file i"buildbot_backup.tar" in the homedirectory that contains
                        essential files to revive the worker after a crash. It
                        deliberately does not include scripts from the repository
                        but adds maintenance and maintenance_worker to automatically
                        fetch the remaining scripts from svn.
                        It also includes locally modified scripts.

==Source bots==

sloccount		Used by a source bot only, for getting some source code metrics
				using static analysis

==Notes for the above scripts==
you probably only need to adapt the params of your configure line in steps.config.

currently the following hooks are in place:
	site_buildprep which is called at the end of buildprep
	site_compile_post which is indeed called th the end of compile

the scripts have to get copied by the prepare step and must reside in the source_root directory

ithe rest should work out the box on as many platforms as possible.
As we don't build on all platforms, we need your help.

 
Please send us any updates so that we can
make the scripts cross-platform.

A return code of 65 means that the command should be skipped.
