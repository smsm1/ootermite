=SCRIPTS TO SETUP A BUILDBOT=

==Builder bots==

These files invoked by the buildslave to perform various steps
outlined below.  Note that you may need to modify these for your platform or build slave.
The process for building OpenOffice.org is in the following order:

cws_get 		For getting CWS's from CVS

buildprep		Insert whatever you need in here to prepare the tree for
				building.  For example, copying mozilla, that daft windows.dll or patching.

configure		Runs configure, you supply configure line

bootstrap		Runs bootstrap

compile			Actually does the compile

smoketestoo		Run the smoketest after the build

bundle			Zips up the install set.  The name is supplied
				in $1 by the buildmaster.
				

---------------
==Source bots==

sloccount		Used by a source bot only, for getting some source code metrics
				using static analysis
  
--------------- 
 
==Notes for the above scripts==
These should work out the box on as many platforms as possible.
As we don't build on all platforms, we need your help.
 
Please send us any updates so that we can
make the scripts cross-platform.

A return code of 65 means that the command should be skipped.
