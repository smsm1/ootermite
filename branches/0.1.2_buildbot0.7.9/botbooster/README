BotBooster
==========

This little program retrieves a list of "ready for QA" cws
from the public EIS and forces the Buildbots to build these cws.

The provided manifest.mf is for use with NetBeans because of
the "Class-Path: ." line. By default NetBeans will create the
"Class-Path: lib/" which is not very comfortable and does not 
work with some OpenSource JVMs.
